# Code-Challenge-3
## Title
Week 3 JavaScript Code Challenge

## Description

This repository contains my solutions to the Week 3 JavaScript coding challenge. The challenge is organized into a folder with a dedicated `.js` file, `.html` file, `.json` file and `.css` file containing the solution code. The challenge is to build a simple application to manage blog posts using a local API and building out the frontend for my app, implementing features to view, add, update, and delete posts.


### Challenge:

#### **Blog Post Manager **

This is a deliverable-driven challenge with the following deliverables:

- A user can see all blog post titles and the images in the list. 
- A user can click on a post title from the #post-list and see its   details. 
- A user can add a new blog post. 
- The program should have a main() function that invokes displayPosts and addNewPostListener after the DOM has fully loaded and started the program logic.
- A user can see the details for the first post as soon as the page loads (without clicking on a post title).
- A user can update the title and content for a post by submitting a form.
- A user can persist updates to a post's title and content by making a PATCH request to the API.
- A user can persist new posts that created by making a POST request to the API.
- A user can persist any post deletions by making a DELETE request to the API.
